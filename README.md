# Lazy Hackintosh Image Generator
[![Swift 4.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-4.1-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org)
## What is this?
This automatical app makes Hackintosh installer from original Macintosh Installer app/disk image.
## Why do I need this?
* If you are on a computer that does not support UEFI.
* If you have hardwares on you computer that causes original installation image kernel panic.
* If you are having trouble continuing installation after restart.
* If you are just too lazy to read the tutorial and install the original.

you'll need this app to alter the original installation image.

## How to use
Just drag the app/dmg file onto the image icon, click start and enjoy.
>If you use Chameleon Bootloader, you can also drop your Chameleon Extra folder onto the app. App then will make this a Chameleon bootable image.
