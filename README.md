# Lazy-Hackintosh-Image-Generator
[![Swift 2.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-2.2-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org)
##What is this?
This is an simple app that automaticly modifies the OS X Installation app/disk image so that it could be used as a Hackintosh image and install OS X on non-apple computers.
##Why do I need this?
* If you are on a computer that does support UEFI.
* If you have hardwares on you computer that causes original installation image kernel panic.
* If you have less than 2GB RAM.
* If you are just too lazy to read the tutorial and install the original.

you'll need this app to alter the original installation image.
##How does this work
Just drag the Install app, or Install app image, or Install ESD image into the top, hit start and enjoy.
>If you use custom kernel, you can drop your kernel on the big black Kernel lable right there.
>>If you use Chameleon Bootloader, you can drop your Chameleon Extra folder onto the /Extra lable to make this an Chameleon bootabale image.
