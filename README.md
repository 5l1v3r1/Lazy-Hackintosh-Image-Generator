# Lazy Hackintosh Image Generator
[![Swift 3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-3.0-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org)
##What is this?
This automation app generates Hackintosh installer from original Mackintosh Installer app/disk image.
##Why do I need this?
* If you are on a computer that does not support UEFI.
* If you have hardwares on you computer that causes original installation image kernel panic.
* If you have less than 2GB RAM.
* If you are just too lazy to read the tutorial and install the original.

you'll need this app to alter the original installation image.

##How does this work
Just drag the app/dmg file onto the image icon, click start and enjoy.
>If you use Chameleon Bootloader, you can also drop your Chameleon Extra folder onto the app. App then will make this a Chameleon bootable image.

##Shut up and gimmi the app
Just download the [LazyHackintoshGenerator.app.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arslan2012/Lazy-Hackintosh-Image-Generator/master/LazyHackintoshGenerator.app.zip). It will keep updating to the latest version.
