# Lazy Hackintosh Image Generator
[![Swift 3.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-3.0-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org)
## What is this?
This automatical app makes Hackintosh installer from original Macintosh Installer app/disk image.
## Why do I need this?
* If you are on a computer that does not support UEFI.
* If you have hardwares on you computer that causes original installation image kernel panic.
* If you are having trouble continuing installation after restart.
* If you are just too lazy to read the tutorial and install the original.

you'll need this app to alter the original installation image.

## How to use
Just drag the app/dmg file onto the image icon, click start and enjoy.
>If you use Chameleon Bootloader, you can also drop your Chameleon Extra folder onto the app. App then will make this a Chameleon bootable image.

## Shut up and gimmi the app
Just download the [LazyHackintoshGenerator.app.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arslan2012/Lazy-Hackintosh-Image-Generator/master/LazyHackintoshGenerator.app.zip). It will keep updating to the latest version.

# Warning! Development on hold.
## Warning this app doesn't support High Sierra......yet
I just guraduated from college, I'm trying to rent a place to live, move and so many other thing I need to do.
So the app's development is on hold for roughly a month, and the app doesn't support High Sierra yet, It will say something about OSInstaller.pkg is corrupt. so dont use this app to make High Sierra image I guess.
I will try and attend to the issues as soon as I settle down, Cheers.
